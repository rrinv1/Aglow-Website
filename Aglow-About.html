    </Header>
    <h1 class = about-header> A+ Glow was created to solve a real problem college students face every day: finding affordable, accessible beauty and self-care services. With rising prices, limited transportation, and busy schedules, students often struggle to access the services they need to feel confident and cared for.

Our team, six students with strengths in strategy, finance, competitive analysis, innovation, and growth—designed A+ Glow as a campus-centered solution. The platform connects students to discounted, verified services offered by cosmetology students and licensed professionals on or near campus. This allows service providers to build experience and certification hours while giving students access to high-quality, affordable beauty care.

Backed by market insights from the $100B+ beauty industry and a student audience increasingly focused on self-care, A+ Glow aims to become a trusted community within college campuses. Our mission is simple: make self-care accessible, convenient, and affordable for every student—while empowering the next generation of beauty professionals.</h1>
